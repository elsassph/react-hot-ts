# FuseBox example

A minimal [FuseBox][1] + Typescript + React with hot reload using [react-hmr-ts][2].

Thanks to `react-hmr-ts`:

- React component can be hot-reloaded without state loss,
- Components reload deep behind `PureComponent/shouldComponentUpdate`,
- And even arrow function fields can reload.

The example doesn't include any resources loading (e.g. CSS, images...).
