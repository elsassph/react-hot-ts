# React HMR for TypeScript

A lightweight, Typescript-native, Babel-free, plugin-free, implementation of [react-hot-loader][1].

Add React Hot Module Replacement in your TypeScript / Webpack projects!:

- Compile-time transformation is done using a TypeScript compiler hook,
- Supports both React component classes and functional components,
- [Webpack][2] + [ts-loader][3] ready, but can support other bundlers and loaders with sufficient HMR / transformer APIs,
- Reliable HMR feature based on Dan Abramov's [react-proxy][4] (note: you should alias it to [react-stand-in][5] when targeting ES6),
- Support both ES5 and ES6 compilation targets.

**Bonus:**

- rewrites arrow functions to be hot-reload friendly (can be opt-out),
- ensures React functions and classes have a "display name", for enhanced debugging experience.

## Installation

```
npm install react-hmr-ts -D
```
Or
```
yarn add react-hmr-ts -D
```

## Webpack configuration

Just 2 steps:

1. Make your Webpack configuration "hot" for development

    See guide: https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/#enabling-hmr

2. Configure the TypeScript loader with a custom transformer (you can keep it in your production builds)

```javascript
const hmrTransformer = require('react-hmr-ts/lib/transformer');
/*...*/

module.exports = {
    /*...*/
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.tsx?$/,
            use: [{
                loader: 'ts-loader',
                options: {
                    // enable TS HMR transformation
                    getCustomTransformers: {
                        before: [ hmrTransformer() ]
                    }
                }
            }]
        }
        /*...*/
    ]
    /*...*/
}
```

### Transformer options

Although they shouldn't be needed for normal use cases, the transformers has a few options:

Usage: `hmrTransformer(options)`

Where `options` is an object with the following optional fields:

- `disable`: force release mode, disregarding `NODE_ENV` value,
- `keepArrows`: opt-out of arrow functions rewriting; this can avoid a lot of extra code (and maybe subtle issues) when targeting ES5 instead of ES6,
- `hmrRuntime`: (advanced) specify an alternative module to be required for the client HMR runtime logic.

Example: `hmrTransformer({ keepArrows: true })`

### Attention NODE_ENV

You must set the `NODE_ENV` environment (e.g. `process.env.NODE_ENV`) to `"production"` to disable the transform.
You will see this message in the console:
```
[react-hmr-ts] disabled for production
```
*Note: Webpack's `mode` is [not sufficient](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7074).*

## React usage

Once the compiler transformation is in place, you just need to wrap your root `ReactDOM.render` call:

```typescript
import { hot } from 'react-hmr-ts';

hot(module)( ReactDOM.render(<App/>) );
```

When building for release, only the HMR runtime will be replaced by a no-op.

Now run Webpack dev server and enjoy live component updates!

## Known issues

### Only `.tsx` files are considered

If you use `.ts` and manual `React.createComponent` code, it won't be registered for HMR.

**Workaround** is to use `.tsx` ;)

### Passing non-exported React classes/functions references

Non-exported class or function won't be reloaded if their reference is kept outside the module.

```typescript
// A.js
class A extends Component {...};
export function provideA() {
    return A;
}

// B.js
import {provideA} from 'A';
export class B extends Component {
    private ARef;
    constructor() {
        this.ARef = provideA();
    }
    render() {
        return <ARef/>;
    }
}
```

**Workaround** is to export the class/function even if it won't be used from exports.
